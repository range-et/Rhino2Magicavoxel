# A magicavoxel convertor for rhino

This is a simple converter for Rhino that exports files into the .vox format for MagicaVoxel from rhino, specifically grasshopper files.
It uses a singular dependecy - the File2Vox commandline program as written by  Zarbuz 
The git repo for that project is here : https://github.com/Zarbuz/FileToVox
The latest built that this specific grasshopper implementation has been tested with is FileToVox 1.9.2
The link to that is here https://github.com/Zarbuz/FileToVox/releases/tag/1.9.2
The code is rather straightwforawrd - load things up and then hit export to get a .vox file
